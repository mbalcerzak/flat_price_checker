# "Should I buy this flat?" - price checker for gumtree apartment ads in Warsaw

How would I know...? And as if any one of us could affrod a house now...
To ease the pain I created a joke app that can help give a user some insights on how exaclty a terrible deal that flat is. Or maybe you will find a good deal? Who knows


## How this project came to existence:
1. I have been scraping apartment ads since January 2021
2. Every month I uploaded summarised statistics with average price per square metre in each disctrict for each "size" category
3. I created a dashabord in Streamlit that helps visualise data from ads and combines it with the statistics I have been gathering

By choosing to see a random flat on the app user can see the collected price history of that flat. Some flats have changed price multiple times!


## Future app development
- create a pipeline (data scraping -> processing -> model training -> live inference)
- give user more insights using Machine Learning models
